raw/timescreen/2000-03-15T21:50:50+10:00.f6b5d70.timescreen timescreen timescreen: 2.x (Earliest found in backups)\\n\\nFeaturing\\n* basic width detection\\n* random "fortune"\\n* seconds indicator ("groovybar")\\n* hourly BEL chimes\\n\\noriginal changelog (obtained from 4.x. probably written 3.x)\\n\\n2.x's (early 2000)\\n . function groovybar as a "second hand"\\n . slightly better random fortune setup\\n\\n1.x's (1999ish)\\n . internal looping\\n . argument for width\\n . implemented random fortunes\\n\\nbetas: (1998ish)\\n . seperate scripts for different fonts.\\n . very basic execution of concept\\n . no error checking, nothing fancy\\n . no internal looping

raw/timescreen/2001-12-12T13:48:30+10:00.7dbe0b2.timescreen timescreen timescreen: 4.x (catchup. No intermediate versions found)\\n\\n4.x's (late 2000ish)\\n . config file (-rc= )\\n . figlet binary option (-figbin= )\\n\\n3.x's (middle 2000ish)\\n . double-width secondbar when width is wide enough\\n . new commandline options for: (they should be obvious I hope)\\n      -w=xx   (set width)\\n      -l      (turn on looping)\\n      -b      (turn on beeps)\\n      -f      (turn on fortunes)\\n      -m      (turn on mail check)\\n      -s      (turn on secondbar)\\n      -fn1    (figlet font for date)\\n      -fn2    (figlet font for time)\\n      -d      (double-height secondbar)\\n . screen not cleared on EVERY minute. Only when nescessary now.\\n . improved sh compliancy (tested against ash mostly)\\n   and uses /usr/bin/zsh by default (5x better CPU performance\\n   compared to bash. marginally worse memory usage)\\n . clock (not date tho) is in bold. easier to see :)



raw/2003-05-01_10:06:50__showtime showtime showtime: Turns a number of seconds into days/hours/etc

raw/timescreen/2005-01-12T07:12:30+10:00.f5b7c98.timescreen timescreen timescreen: 4.x (catchup. Minor bugfix/polish. Added fmail.log watch)
raw/2005-05-04_08:34:29__worldtime worldtime worldtime: v1: time in local+14 named places. Uses TZ= repeatedly
raw/timescreen/2005-08-03T19:53:46+10:00.f7b9988.timescreen timescreen timescreen: 4.x (catchup. Added a sleep to lose fmail.log race)
raw/timescreen/2013-06-13T09:24:31+10:00.66062f9.timescreen timescreen timescreen: 4.3 (catchup. No intermediates found)\\n\\n4.3 (2013 march 20)\\n. removed chkmail option. I dont use that anymore.\\n . cleaned up the duobleheight groovybar (echo was adding unwanted newline)\\n\\n4.2 (2012 feb 16)\\n . using TOIlet instead of figlet. Still calls /usr/bin/figlet though,\\n      but -c (center) option is not available, so has been removed from\\n      script. Some leading spacing added in places to hackishly compensate.\\n\\n4.1 (late 2010ish)\\n . barest minimum of changes from control codes to tput, so as to work in tmux\\n   ...not a full replacement. Just enough for my common use.
